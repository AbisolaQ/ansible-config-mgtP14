# Project 14
Experience Continuous Integration With Jenkins | Ansible | Artifactory | Sonarqube | PHP
In this project, you will understand and get hands on experience around the entire concept around CI/CD from applications perspective. To fully gain real expertise around this idea, it is best to see it in action across different programming languages and from the platform perspective too. From the application perspective, we will be focusing on PHP here; there are more projects ahead that are based on Java, Node.js, .Net and Python. By the time you start working on Terraform, Docker and Kubernetes projects, you will get to see the platform perspective of CI/CD in action.
To emphasize a typical CI Pipeline further, let us explore the diagram below.

![A typical CI Pipeline](<Images_P14/A_typical_CI_Pipeline .png>)

- __Version Control:__ This is the stage where developersâ€™ code gets committed and pushed after they have tested their work locally.
- __Build:__ Depending on the type of language or technology used, we may need to build the codes into binary executable files (in case of compiled languages) or just package the codes together with all necessary dependencies into a deployable package (in case of interpreted languages).
- __Unit Test:__ Unit tests that have been developed by the developers are tested. Depending on how the CI job is configured, the entire pipeline may fail if part of the tests fails, and developers will have to fix this failure before starting the pipeline again. A Job by the way, is a phase in the pipeline. Unit Test is a phase, therefore it can be considered a job on its own.
- __Deploy:__ Once the tests are passed, the next phase is to deploy the compiled or packaged code into an artifact repository. This is where all the various versions of code including the latest will be stored. The CI tool will have to pick up the code from this location to proceed with the remaining parts of the pipeline.
- __Auto Test:__ Apart from Unit testing, there are many other kinds of tests that are required to analyse the quality of code and determine how vulnerable the software will be to external or internal attacks. These tests must be automated, and there can be multiple environments created to fulfil different test requirements. For example, a server dedicated for Integration Testing will have the code deployed there to conduct integration tests. Once that passes, there can be other sub-layers in the testing phase in which the code will be deployed to, so as to conduct further tests. Such are User Acceptance Testing (UAT), and another can be Penetration Testing. These servers will be named according to what they have been designed to do in those environments. A UAT server is generally be used for UAT, SIT server is for Systems Integration Testing, PEN Server is for Penetration Testing and they can be named whatever the naming style or convention in which the team is used. An environment does not necessarily have to reside on one single server. In most cases it might be a stack as you have defined in your Ansible Inventory. All the servers in the inventory/dev are considered as Dev Environment. The same goes for inventory/stage (Staging Environment) inventory/preprod (Pre-production environment), inventory/prod (Production environment), etc. So, it is all down to naming convention as agreed and used company or team wide.
- __Deploy to production:__ Once all the tests have been conducted and either the release manager or whoever has the authority to authorize the release to the production server is happy, he gives green light to hit the deploy button to ship the release to production environment. This is an Ideal Continuous Delivery Pipeline. If the entire pipeline was automated and no human is required to manually give the Go decision, then this would be considered as Continuous Deployment. Because the cycle will be repeated, and every time there is a code commit and push, it causes the pipeline to trigger, and the loop continues over and over again.
- __Measure and Validate:__ This is where live users are interacting with the application and feedback is being collected for further improvements and bug fixes. 

In this project, I will be setting up a CI/CD Pipeline for a __PHP__ based application. The overall CI/CD process looks like the architecture below.

![SIMULATING A TYPICAL CI/CD PIPELINE FOR A PHP BASED APPLICATION](Images_P14/Project_goal_simulate.png)

This project is architected in two major repositories with each repository containing its own CI/CD pipeline written in a Jenkinsfile

- __ansible-config-mgt__ Repository: This repository employs the use of Jenkinsfile to configure infrastructure required to carry out processes for our application to run using ansible roles.

- __PHP-todo__ Repository: This repository uses Jenkinsfile to run the processes needed to build the PHP application. These processes include testing, building, packaging and deploy.
  
For this project, i will be using __RHEL 8 and ubuntu 20.04 instances__. The tools we will be using to build, test, run code analysis, package and deploy our PHP application are Github, jenkins, Sonarqube and jfrog artifactory.

__CONFIGURING THE JENKINS SERVER FOR DEPLOYMENT__

RUNNING ANSIBLE PLAYBOOK FROM JENKINS

Now that we have a broad overview of a typical Jenkins pipeline. Let us get the actual Ansible deployment to work.

We will be setting up database and nginx on two different instances using ansible playbook on jenkins UI.

Step 25: We will be setting up database and nginx on two different instances using ansible playbook on jenkins UI.
![Alt text](Images_P14/start-nginx-db-todo-instance.png)

Step 26: Install ansible and it's dependencies.
![Alt text](Images_P14/install-ansible.png)
![Alt text](Images_P14/install-ansible-dependencies.png)

Step 27: Installing Ansible plugin in Jenkins UI
![Alt text](Images_P14/install-ansible-plugin-on-jenkins.png)

Step  28: Then go to "global tool configuration" under "manage jenkins" to set up ansible plugin to work with jenkins
![Alt text](Images_P14/ansible-installation.png)

step 29:Creating Jenkinsfile to run the ansible playbook on jenkins.

Jenkins needs to export the ANSIBLE_CONFIG environment variable. You can put the ansible.cfg file alongside Jenkinsfile in the deploy directory. This way, anyone can easily identify that everything in there relates to deployment.

We need to set the credentials for ansible to be able to work with jenkins smoothly. To do this we go to manage credentials under manage jenkins.
![Alt text](Images_P14/set-up-ansible-credentials.png)
![Alt text](Images_P14/addsshprivatekey.png)

STEP 30: Using the Pipeline Syntax tool in Ansible, generate the syntax to create environment variables to set.
![Alt text](Images_P14/snippet-generator.png)
![Alt text](Images_P14/generate-pipeline-script.png)
![Alt text](Images_P14/pipeline-script.png)

step 31:
Then in the inventory/dev file, we update the IP address for our database and nginx.
![Alt text](Images_P14/update-dev-inventory-file-with-ip-address.png)

step 32:
We set up roles for the database and nginx. The database roles will create a database - tooling and a database user - webaccess. We will go ahead and edit the _defaults/main.yml file in the mysql role.
![Alt text](Images_P14/set-up-roles-for-dbmysql.png)

step 33: set up playbook/site.yml
![Alt text](Images_P14/playbook-setup.png)

step 34: We push to github and then click on "scan repository now" the ansible-config-mgt on the jenikins UI. The ansible-config_mgt repository is scanned for any branch that has a Jenkinsfile and then builds.
![!\[Alt text\](Images_P14/Ansible-build-success1.png)](Images_P14/Ansible-build-success.png)

step 35: PARAMETERIZING 'Jenkinsfile' FOR ANSIBLE DEPLOYMENT

To deploy to other environments, we will need to use parameters.

Update Jenkinsfile to introduce parameterization. Below is just one parameter. It has a default value in case if no value is specified at execution. It also has a description so that everyone is aware of its purpose.
pipeline {
    agent any

    parameters {
      string(name: 'inventory', defaultValue: 'dev',  description: 'This is the inventory file for the environment to deploy configuration')
    }

In the Ansible execution section, remove the hardcoded inventory/dev and replace with '${inventory}'

![Alt text](Images_P14/Ansible-build-success.png)

CI/CD PIPELINE FOR TODO APPLICATION
We already have tooling website as a part of deployment through Ansible. Here we will introduce another PHP application to add to the list of software products we are managing in our infrastructure.This particular application is an ideal application to show an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline.

Our goal here is to deploy the application onto servers directly from Artifactory rather than from github.

Clone the PHP-Todo repository from github

$ git clone https://github.com/darey-devops/php-todo.git

![Alt text](Images_P14/fork-clone-tooling-repo-and-add-phptodofolder.png)

On you Jenkins server, install PHP and its dependencies

$ sudo yum install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm -y

$ sudo yum install https://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-8.rpm -y

$ sudo dnf install dnf-utils -y

$ sudo dnf module reset php -y

$ sudo dnf module install php:remi-7.4

$ sudo dnf update -y

$ sudo yum install wget php-{pear,cgi,common,curl,mbstring,gd,mysqlnd,gettext,bcmath,json,xml,fpm,intl,zip,imap}

$ php -v

![Alt text](Images_P14/install-and-enable-php.png)

Install composer

$ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

$ sudo mv composer.phar /usr/bin/composer


Install plot plugin and artifactory plugin. We will use plot plugin to display tests reports and code coverage information while the Artifactory plugin will be used to easily upload code artifacts into an Artifactory server.

![Alt text](Images_P14/install-plot-and-artifactory-plugin.png)

Make sure to edit the inbound rules
![Alt text](Images_P14/edit-inbound-security-group-rule.png)

Edit inventoryfile, ci environment, static assignment, artifactory file, playbook site.yml file
![Alt text](Images_P14/edit-ci.png)
![Alt text](Images_P14/update-inventory-file.png)
![Alt text](Images_P14/update-static-assignment-artifactoryyml.png)
![Alt text](Images_P14/update-playbook-site-yml-file.png)

Run ansible playbook to install Artifactory
![Alt text](Images_P14/Ansible-Artifactory-installation-success.png)

We can now use our IP address to access the artifactory
![Alt text](Images_P14/access-artifactory-ipaddress.png)

Setup the artifactory and create a repo named queen
username-admin Password=password
![Alt text](Images_P14/login-to-jfrog.png)
![Alt text](Images_P14/create-jfrog-repo.png)
![Alt text](Images_P14/select-generic-repo.png)
![Alt text](Images_P14/creating-repo-a.png)


In Jenkins UI configure Artifactory to work with jenkins
![Alt text](Images_P14/jfrog-config.png)
![Alt text](Images_P14/Test-jfrog-connection.png)

Integrate Artifactory repository with Jenkins

Create a Jenkinsfile in the PHP-Todo repository.

Using Blue Ocean, create a multibranch Jenkins pipeline.

On the database server, create database and user ansible-config-mgt and create a database for the PHP-Todo.

Configure the defaults/main.yml in the mysql roles to add a database - 'homestead' and user - 'homestead'.

Replace the user's host with the jenkins private IP address.
![Alt text](Images_P14/edit-db-roles.png)

edit db-playbook
![Alt text](Images_P14/install-db.png)

Push and run using build with parameters on inventory/dev
![Alt text](Images_P14/push-build-with-parameterswithdev.png)

To conifirm that homestead database was created, log into the instance and run the command
$ sudo mysql

mysql> show databases;
![Alt text](Images_P14/confirm-db-user.png)



Install mysql client on the jenkins server so the jenkins can remotely log in to the database

$ sudo yum install mysql -y
![Alt text](Images_P14/download-mysql-on-jenkins.png)
![Alt text](<Images_P14/set bind address and restart mysql server.png>)
.

DB_HOST=172.31.23.171
DB_DATABASE=homestead
DB_USERNAME=homestead
DB_PASSWORD=sePret^i
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_PORT=3306

![Alt text](<Images_P14/update and connect to-db.png>)
![Alt text](<Images_P14/confirm you can connect to the db from jenkins.png>)

Push to github and build to create tables
![Alt text](<Images_P14/push and build to create tables.png>)

In the Prepare Dependencies section, the required file by PHP is .env so we are renaming .env.sample to .env.

Composer is used by PHP to install all the dependent libraries used by the application. php artisan uses the .env file to setup the required database objects.

After successful run of this step, login to the database, run show tables and you will see the tables being created.

$ mysql -h <database-IP-address> -u homestead -p
![Alt text](<Images_P14/tables created.png>)

Update the Jenkinsfile to include Unit tests step

 stage('Execute Unit Tests') {
      steps {
             sh './vendor/bin/phpunit'
      }

![Alt text](<Images_P14/update jenkins file.png>)
![Alt text](<Images_P14/run unit test.png>)


Code Quality Analysis

For PHP the most commonly tool used for code quality analysis is phploc.

The data produced by phploc can be ploted onto graphs in Jenkins.

Add the code analysis step in Jenkinsfile. The output of the data will be saved in build/logs/phploc.csv file.

![Alt text](<Images_P14/add code analysis step.png>)

Install phploc

$ sudo dnf --enablerepo=remi install php-phpunit-phploc

$ wget -O phpunit https://phar.phpunit.de/phpunit-7.phar

$ sudo chmod +x phpunit
![Alt text](Images_P14/install-phploc-phpunit.png)

Plot the data using plot Jenkins plugin.

This plugin provides generic plotting (or graphing) capabilities in Jenkins. It will plot one or more single values variations across builds in one or more plots. Plots for a particular job (or project) are configured in the job configuration screen, where each field has additional help information. Each plot can have one or more lines (called data series). After each build completes the plotsâ€™ data series latest values are pulled from the CSV file generated by phploc.
